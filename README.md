A repository that holds the HTML, CSS and Javascript of my personal portfolio website. 

# How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Javascript

# Optimizations:
I aim to continually add new features to the website and improving code where possible to make it more interactive and seamless for a better user experience.

# Lessons Learned:
This was my first attempt at using Tailwind CSS and I have developed a much better proficiency in using the library of classes to create my website.
